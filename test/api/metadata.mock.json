In order to survive he comes up with a way to miniaturize the battery and figures out that the battery can power something else. Thus Iron Man is born.

Unbeknownst to the neighbours, hidden deep beneath this home is a vast secret hideout. Surrounded by an army of tireless, little yellow minions, we discover Gru, planning the biggest heist in the history of the world. He is going to steal the moon (Yes, the moon!) to prove to his Mum that he is better than the other super-villains, especially the new kid on the block, Vector. Gru delights in all things wicked. Armed with his arsenal of shrink rays, freeze guns and battle-ready vehicles for land and air, he vanquishes all who stand in his way. Until the day he encounters the immense will of three little orphaned girls who look at him and see something that no one else has ever seen: a potential dad.",

Meanwhile, the Lannisters maintain their hold on King's Landing, though stirrings in the North threaten to alter the balance of power; Robb Stark, King of the North, faces a major calamity as he tries to build on his victories; a massive army of wildlings led by Mance Rayder march for the Wall; and Daenerys Targaryen--reunited with her dragons--attempts to raise an army in her quest for the Iron Throne.",
