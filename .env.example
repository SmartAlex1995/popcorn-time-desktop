# Support non-native movie formats
#
# Note that this flag is not supported on linux because WebChimera does not
# support it

FLAG_SUPPORT_NON_NATIVE_CODECS_FALLBACK=false



# Strictly validate torrents
#
# This comes at the cost of reducing the number of possible torrents, which
# could mean slower torrents ðŸ˜­

FLAG_FORCE_STRICT_TORRENT_VALIDATION=false



# Allow torrents that do not have a quality.
#
# Butter validates and filters torrents based on a number of factors. Sometimes
# torrents with a large seed count fail are filtered because their quality cannot
# be determined. This flag allows those torrents to be verified and will most likely
# increase the seed count of torrents at the cost of those torrents being unverified

FLAG_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_TORRENTS=false



# Allow video whose subtitles are rendered as part of the movie.
#
# This makes removing them impossible. If you can tolerate these kinds of movies
# enable them and your will likely increase your seeder count

FLAG_ALLOW_SUBTITLED_MOVIES=false
