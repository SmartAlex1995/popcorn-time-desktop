# These allow you to enable experimental features or non-recommended in
# PopcornTime with the flip of a switch!



# Allow torrents that do not have a quality.
#
# Butter validates and filters torrents based on a number of factors. Sometimes
# torrents with a large seed count fail are filtered because their quality cannot
# be determined. This flag allows those torrents to be verified and will most likely
# increase the seed count of torrents at the cost of those torrents being unverified.

FLAG_UNVERIFIED_TORRENTS=false



# Allow 'complete season' torrents
#
# Butter validates and filters torrents based on a number of factors. Sometimes
# torrents with a large seed count fail are filtered because their quality cannot
# be determined. This flag allows those torrents to be verified and will most likely
# increase the seed count of torrents at the cost of those torrents being unverified.

FLAG_UNVERIFIED_TORRENTS=false



# Allow video whose subtitles are rendered as part of the movie.
#
# This makes removing them impossible. If you can tolerate these kinds of movies
# enable them and your will likely increase your seeder count.

FLAG_SUBTITLE_EMBEDDED_MOVIES=false



# Show multiple video qualities
#
# Ideally, PopcornTime would be able to select the best torrent for the user, as
# opposed to having them manually chose. Manually choosing allows users to pick
# which qualify (ex. 1080p, 720p, etc) of torrent they want.
